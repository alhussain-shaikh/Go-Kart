# Go-Kart
We notice the huge rush in the markets and malls on holiday as well as in the weekends. The problem occurs at the customer end to find their likely products and to pay the bills standing at long queue; both of these are time consuming and tiring.

# Objective
Items that are put in a smart shopping cart are read one by one and the bill is generated and displayed. After the final bill is generated the customer pays the bill by using an portal installed on their mobile phones. The aim is to reduce the time consumption needed for the billing system.
